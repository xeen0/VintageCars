Called the MAT Stratos Coupe, the first-production version of the super-desirable sports car is now up for auction at Bonhams, and, as you can imagine, this particular Stratos Coupe is going to fetch a steep price.",
    historyHead:"The Lancia Stratos is arguably one of the most sought-after classic sports cars today.",
    history:"It only lasted five years (1973 to 1978)on the market, but in the short time that it was around, the Stratos made a huge mark as a sports car and as a rally car. The Stratos HF rally racer, which was based on the production sports car, won the World Rally Championship in 1974, 1975, and 1976."+"\n" +"As far as five-year runs go, the Stratos arguably had one of the most memorable of any sports car of its era. Unfortunately, Lancia stopped producing the Stratos after only five years in the market, and it wasn’t until 2010 that the Stratos name returned to headlines, except it wasn’t a Lancia anymore. German billionaire and self-professed rally fan Michael Stoschek took the reins in bringing the Stratos nameplate back from the dead. He helped fund a startup project called the “New Stratos” that had one objective in mind: build a modern, production-ready version of the legendary race car."+"The New Stratos sat under a Ferrari F430 Scuderia, and while Ferrari itself took kindly to the project, the Italian automaker declined to supply parts for the 25 cars planned and the project was eventually scuttled."+"\n"+"It was a huge tease that amounted to nothing, at least not for the next eight years. It wasn’t until 2018 when former Pininfarina special projects manager Paolo Garella revived the project under Manufattura Automobili Torino (MAT), a company he founded after leaving the Italian design house.",
    finalThoghts:"You’re not imagining any of this. The Lancia Stratos is back, albeit under a different name. This is the MAT Stratos and it looks absolutely stunning! Disregard the fact that this is the first-production MAT Stratos — there’s that provenance! — and the car still looks amazing. The Alitalia livery evokes a pure nostalgic vibe and those rally light casings on the hood add to the sports car’s identity. The Ferrari F430 Scuderia-sourced 4.3-liter V-8 engine produces a healthy 540 horsepower and 383 pound-feet of torque. The MAT Stratos doesn’t just look like a sports car; it’s powered like one, too."+"\n"+"Sadly for most of us, getting our hands on the first-production MAT Stratos is going to be tricky. Not only is it a desirable piece, but it’s also expected to fetch close to $1 million. That’s hypercar-levels of money that you’re going to have to part with if you want to score this rare beauty. I don’t know if the cost justifies the ownership, but I certainly wouldn’t begrudge the individual who splurges on this beauty.",

It is the very car that the elite media drove way back in the mid-1990s when Ferrari was trying to spread the word about its latest and greatest."+"\n"+"According to the car’s listing on Worldwide Auctioneers, it was the very model that was used for Shin Yoskikawa’s cut-away illustration. It was even sent around the world to be used in the development of scale models like those sold by Burago, Maisto, and Tamiya. Commemorative postage stamps were even based on this specific model.",
    finalThoghts:"Fifty years of racing, fifty years of winning, fifty years of hard work."+"\n"+"And, that’s wasn’t a joke. Ferrari’s racing history aside, all that experience went into the F50. As a successor to the Ferrari F40, the F50 naturally had to be better, but in this case, the F50 took all Ferrari’s F1 know-how and condensed it into street-legal form. Its construction featured a lightweight carbon fiber tub, wishbone suspension at all four corners, and that sculpted bodywork was developed exclusively inside a wind tunnel. That’s why the F50 is nowhere near as aggressive as the F40 – it was designed to be as aerodynamic as possible and light. Of course, that’s no surprise as the early and mid-1990s served as a temporal home for other great exotics like the McLaren F1 and Lamborghini Diablo VT.",
